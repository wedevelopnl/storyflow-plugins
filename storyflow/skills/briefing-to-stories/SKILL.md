# Briefing to Stories

Generate user stories from an accepted briefing.

## Arguments

The user provides a briefing ID as argument: `/storyflow:briefing-to-stories <id>`

If no ID is provided, ask the user for one. Suggest running `/storyflow:briefings` to see available briefings.

## Process

### 1. Load project context

Read `.storyflow/config.json` to get `customer_name`, `asset_name`, `customer_id`, `asset_id`.
- If the file does not exist: tell the user to run `/storyflow:setup` first. Do not proceed without config.

### 2. Load briefing

Call `mcp__storyflow__get-briefing` with the provided ID.

**Validate eligibility**: Check the briefing's available transitions (included in the response). The `create-briefing-stories` MCP tool requires the briefing to be in a status that allows story creation. If this is not possible, inform the user of the current status and the available transitions instead. Stop here if story creation is not available.

### 3. Check existing stories

Call `mcp__storyflow__get-briefing-stories` with the briefing ID.

If stories already exist, warn the user and wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### 4. Fetch guidelines

Call `mcp__storyflow__get-briefing-to-stories-guidelines` for the complete story generation guidelines.

Follow the guidelines strictly throughout the remaining steps. The guidelines contain:
- Role and approach for story generation
- Briefing-to-stories methodology (analysis, grouping, epic organization, review)
- Story writing format (language guardrails, acceptance criteria, complexity, priority)
- Analysis, generation, and review phases
- Workflow with presentation formats, save structure, and report format

### 5. Analyze codebase

Dispatch the `codebase-analyzer` agent with the briefing context (asset name, briefing title, functional document content). Wait for the functional analysis result.

### 6. Story plan, write, review, save

Follow the Workflow section from the guidelines:

1. **Story plan** (Phase 1 review gate): propose a plan, iterate until the architect says "approved"
2. **Write stories** (Phase 2 review gate): write full descriptions, iterate until the architect says "save"
3. **Save**: call `mcp__storyflow__create-briefing-stories` with the briefing ID and the JSON data structured as described in the guidelines

### 7. Transition and report

After stories are created, fetch the briefing again to check available transitions. Apply the appropriate transition to advance the briefing. Report results following the guidelines report format.

**Note:** Stories generated from a briefing start in the `Accepted` status (not `Submitted`). The agency has committed to the work by generating the stories, so the commitment is implicit; the agency still needs to confirm the scope explicitly by moving each story to `Scoped` before refinement is allowed.
